Stochastic, Multiple Healthcare Facility Location and Capacity Configuration Based on a Location-Allocation Model
The stochastic, multiple healthcare facility location and capacity configuration problem (SMHFCP) is to prescribe the locations of new facilities, given a set of potential sites, as well as the capacity assigned to each specified service at each facility in each time period, allowing openings, expansions, contractions, and closures over the planning horizon, so that the total expected excess revenue (i.e., the expected amount by which revenue exceeds cost) of the system is maximized. This paper presents a location-allocation model which assigns demand from each population center to a particular facility. This paper proposes two solution methods. The first is a column-generation heuristic that deals with multi-period stochastic demand in each subproblem. The second is an approximation method that estimates the stochastic objective function value with a bounding procedure to assess the quality of a solution. Computational experiments compare these two methods in application to two case studies, one involves 36 census tracts in Brazos County, Texas; the other, 101 zip codes in mid-Texas.
